## **User Experience**

* Content 
 
### *Admin Users*

- To allow super users the ability to have easy access to the admin side. Allowing for a responsive website that allows them to shape there website, blog and bookings as they see fit.

### *User Stories*

Using the GitHub I used the agile methods and tools to allow myself to create and keep track of the User Stories I set out for myself in the beginning.

## Future Ideas

After building the app, there were a couple of ideas that in the future I would like to implement. 
* The ability for other users to be able to co-create events, adding one of more people to edit and delete events. In acse it was a company making an event, rather than sharing a log in.
* Potentially linking up to some ecommerce and selling tickets for the "event".
* Making it more into a DnD creation site like DnD Beyond see [here](https://www.dndbeyond.com/)
